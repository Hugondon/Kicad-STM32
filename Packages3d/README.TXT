
SORRY !!!

GitHub does not allow uploading files greater than 25MB. STEP files are much larger !
Therefore, you will find here WRL files only.

On the other hand, WRL is the new standard format for KiCad, is faster to load, and does the job...

The STL files will be uploaded somewhere else, probably on GrabCAD.

A link will be provided as soon as a solution to this problem is found.
